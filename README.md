from his followers if any of them wish to give voluntarily. Abdul opened an account on TipMe with a monthly subscription fee of $19.99 and then he gets his 
unique TipMe link i.e tipme.com/abdul, in his newly opened TipMe account he has a wallet where the monetary support and gifts from his fans go into, 
he has a message section where he receives the messages that comes with the monetary gift his fans sends etc.
He updated all his social media account bio with his TipMe link with the caption "If you love what i do and wish to support me, please go to my TipMe 
link tipme.com/abdul". After a few days, Abdul starts receiving notifications from TipMe about receiving money from his fans to his TipMe account wallet.
